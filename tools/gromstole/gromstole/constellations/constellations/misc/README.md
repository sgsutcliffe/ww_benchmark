The general pattern for a mutation:

`<gene>:[ancestral state]coordinates[+|-][derived state]`

Where `<gene>` is a gene or protein product or `nuc` to denote the genomic nucleotide.

`ancestral state` is the state (either amino acid or nucleotide) in the reference or ancestral genome.

`coordinates` is a coordinate in amino acid relative to the start of the gene or nucleotide relative to the start of the reference genome.

`+|-` optionally states the mutation is an insertion or a deletion rather than a point mutation

`derived state` is the amino acid or nucleotide in the mutation

If the mutation is a deletion then only the ancestral state is given, if an insertion then only the derived state is given
