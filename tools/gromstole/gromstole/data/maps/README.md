# Making maps

- locations.csv is based on the file sent to the group and should be changed so that the location names match those in the actual data. 
- Coordinates entered manually by searching the location names in Google Maps and are approximate.
- note column details any trouble I had allocating lat/lon.
- Region can be modified at will
