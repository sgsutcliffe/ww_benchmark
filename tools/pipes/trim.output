Path to Cutadapt set as: 'cutadapt' (default)
Cutadapt seems to be working fine (tested command 'cutadapt --version')
Cutadapt version: 4.3
single-core operation.
igzip command line interface 2.30.0
igzip detected. Using igzip for decompressing

No quality encoding type selected. Assuming that the data provided uses Sanger encoded Phred scores (default)

AUTO-DETECTING ADAPTER TYPE
===========================
Attempting to auto-detect adapter type from the first 1 million sequences of the first file (>> read1.fastq <<)

Found perfect matches for the following adapter sequences:
Adapter type	Count	Sequence	Sequences analysed	Percentage
smallRNA	0	TGGAATTCTCGG	4000	0.00
Illumina	0	AGATCGGAAGAGC	4000	0.00
Nextera	0	CTGTCTCTTATA	4000	0.00
Unable to auto-detect most prominent adapter from the first specified file (count smallRNA: 0, count Illumina: 0, count Nextera: 0)
Defaulting to Illumina universal adapter ( AGATCGGAAGAGC ). Specify -a SEQUENCE to avoid this behavior).
